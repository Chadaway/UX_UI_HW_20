        <p>Libby's Legacy Breast Cancer Foundation is a non-profit organization baseed in Orlando, Fl. Their mission is to provide comprehensive services to the underserved through education, mammograms, and patient navigation on the journey from diagnosis to survivorship with the compassion to ensure no one fights alone. Even though this organization has been a success, many user have hard time navigating through the website due to broken pages, overwhelming forms and hard to read copy.</p>

      <h1 class="display-4">Research</h1>
      <p>Since I was not very familiar with this organization, I researched the website with my design team to gathr information about their mission. I then conducted interviews to unfold experiences people had with breast cancer and donating. 

        Through my research I wanted to...
        
        Understand how educated people are about breast cancer.
        Discover how often they donated to the cause.
        Identify what motivates people to donate to charty,
        Discover how much money people usually donate.
        Learn about their expereinces with breast cancer.
        Identify womens thoughts on mammograms.

Through my market research, I identified some top direct and indirect competitors: Susan Komen, BreastCancer.org, Lust Garten, and National Cancer Institute. Direct competitors are Breast Cancer focused similar to Libby’s Legacy, while indirect competitors are focused on all cancer or one specific type of cancer..</p>

                <p class="card-text">In order to learn more about the pain points of donating and breast cancer research, I recruited 5 female (since most users would be women based on the topic of this non-profit) participants for user interviews. Here, I focused on asking open-ended questions about their experiences to learn as much as possible about our users and their personal connection to the subject. My team and I also created a survey to get a better understanding of how users donate, how much, and also how often mammograms are scheduled. </p>

Doing so allowed me to gain empathy with the user and helped find patterns and key insights about their experiences donating and emotional connection to breast cancer.

                    Using my understanding of the user, our goals, the architecture, and the user’s interaction with the website, I worked on making informed decisions on how to design Libby’s Legacy screens by sketching low-fidelity wireframes.

                  Now that I had sketched out my ideas, I wanted to test the decisions I made and make sure that the structure and flow of the app is intuitive for our users. Before working on the visual design, I wanted to first make sure that the design was functional. In order to do this, I decided to create a mid fidelity prototype which would help me quickly test the design on real users and make any priority revisions before integrating the branding and visual design.
